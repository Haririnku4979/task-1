Objective: Identify and Handle Suspicious Emails in Cybersecurity
Introduction

Cybercriminals often use deceptive emails to trick users into clicking malicious links or providing sensitive information. One of the most common tactics involves sending emails from addresses that closely resemble legitimate domains (e.g., faceebook.com instead of facebook.com).

As cybersecurity professionals, it is crucial to educate and guide users in identifying and responding to such threats.

Common Tactics Used in Suspicious Emails

Email Spoofing: Using addresses that look very similar to legitimate ones (e.g., faceebook.com, gmai1.com).

Urgent Messages: Creating a false sense of urgency (e.g., "Your account will be deactivated today!").

Phishing Links: Including links asking you to "verify your account" or "reset your password."

Security Instructions for Users
✅ 1. Do Not Click on Suspicious Links

Avoid clicking any links in emails that seem suspicious or unexpected.

Hover over the link to preview the actual URL before clicking.

✅ 2. Carefully Check the Sender's Email Address

Look for small changes in the spelling of known domains.

Be cautious if the domain looks off, even by a single character.

✅ 3. Change Your Passwords Regularly

Use strong, unique passwords for each account.

Update passwords periodically and especially after any suspicious activity.

✅ 4. Use Email Filters and Security Tools

Enable spam filters and phishing detection in your email client.

Use antivirus and email security tools to detect potential threats.

✅ 5. Report Suspicious Activity Immediately

If you suspect a phishing attempt or have clicked on a suspicious link:

Do not provide any information.

Inform your Cybersecurity or IT team immediately.

Conclusion

Staying vigilant is key to defending against phishing attacks and other email-based threats. Always verify before you click, and when in doubt, report it.
